## Team Members: Aaron Clark, Rocio Martinez, Dylan Cooper, Davey Oswald

## Project Description
- Refrigerator social application that allows users to track what is in their refrigerator and the date it entered.  Also able to view other community members refrigerators and either message or comment.
- This application will be focused on reducing food waste in a community.  This app will provide visibility to a user about what foods are nearing their expiration and should be used, and will also have a social aspect that will allow for local bartering of ingredients among  neighbors.
- MVP:
    - Verified users who can make edits to their own profile and the contents of their refrigerator.
    - Date of addition is clearly displayed alongside each ingredient or item the users fridge.
    - Other users can view but not edit otherâ€™s refrigerators and can directly message or comment through the application and propose exchanges.
